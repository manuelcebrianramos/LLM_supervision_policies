# Supervision Policies Can Shape Long-Term Risk Management in General Purpose AI Models

This repository contains the code and simulation data for the research project **"Supervision Policies Can Shape Long-Term Risk Management in General Purpose AI Models."** The project explores the use of simulation-based frameworks to evaluate and design supervision strategies for mitigating risks associated with general-purpose AI models.

## Repository Structure

- **`Simulation_Code/`**:  
  Contains the Jupyter Notebook implementing the simulation code and prioritization strategies.
  
- **`Simulation_Runs/`**:  
  Includes simulation results split into batches:
  - `First_batch/`: Results from the initial set of simulation runs.
  - `Second_batch/`: The latest and most complete set of experimental results.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manuelcebrianramos/LLM_supervision_policies.git
   cd LLM_supervision_policies
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Simulation_Code/PrioritizationLLMsupervision.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the notebook to reproduce or extend simulations.
